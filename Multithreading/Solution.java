/*There are a group of kids playing a game in a circle to test their arithmetic division skills.
The game starts with Kid 1, who says the number 1 to begin. Then, in clockwise order, each kid 
takes a turn and says the next number, but with the following rules:
 - If the number is divisible by 3 (but not by 5), the kid says "Hi".
 - If the number is divisible by 5 (but not by 3), the kid says "Hello".
 - If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, the kid says "HiHello".
 - Otherwise, the kid simply says the number itself.

The same game rules are now implemented in a multi-threaded environment.
We are given an instance of a HiHelloGame class, which has four methods:

 - hi(printHi) → Prints "Hi" when the number is divisible by 3 only.
 - hello(printHello) → Prints "Hello" when the number is divisible by 5 only.
 - hiHello(printHiHello) → Prints "HiHello" when the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
 - number(printNumber) → Prints the number itself when none of the above conditions are met.

The same instance of HiHelloGame will be shared across four threads:

Thread A: Calls hi() to output "Hi".
Thread B: Calls hello() to output "Hello".
Thread C: Calls hiHello() to output "HiHello".
Thread D: Calls number() to output the number.

Your task is to modify the HiHelloGame class so that it outputs the correct sequence for numbers 
from 1 to N in the correct order according to the rules above.

Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer N.

Output Format:
--------------
Print a string array[].

Constraints:
• 1 <= n <= 10^4
 
 
Sample Input-1:
---------------
5

Sample Output-1:
----------------
1 2 Hi 4 Hello


Sample Input-2:
---------------
15

Sample Output-2:
----------------
1 2 Hi 4 Hello Hi 7 8 Hi Hello 11 Hi 13 14 HiHello
